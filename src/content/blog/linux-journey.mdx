<span class="leadin">I've been using Linux exclusively</span> for over 2 years now and it is honestly the best decision I've ever made in my life. by using Linux not only did I form an understanding of how gnu/Linux works and how to use its tools. but I also discovered some of the best open-source projects I've ever seen like gimp, firefox, and MPV.

In around 2017, I found a Linux [hacking course](https:https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/) on udemy that was on sale. I decided to give it a go and see what I would learn!
the first chapter was on installing kali Linux on a virtual machine. back then I knew nothing about Linux and that was my first encounter with the OS. I ended up not finishing the course because running Linux in a VM on a 14 years old machine was pretty slow but I still learned the basics like navigating the system from the command line and downloading software through apt.

A few years go by and I decide to give Linux another go, but this time not for hacking or pen-testing. just regular daily usage because I got sick of windows slowness and I wanted something new since I had been using Windows my whole life basically. and as with most other Linux users I decided to try out ubuntu first. it was the most well-known one and even though it is not my recommended distro right now for beginners it still works pretty well. so I did it... looked up a tutorial on how to dual boot ubuntu and Linux, downloaded the iso, and installed it.

for the first few days, I was switching between windows and ubuntu constantly but as the months went by, I started booting into ubuntu more and more often, and at some point, windows became just a meaningless option in grub.

And just to clarify, at this point, I wasn't using any of the programs I am using today like vim, emacs, and Window managers, ubuntu was pretty much a bootloader for firefox.

one day, while browsing [r/unixporn](https:reddit.com/r/unixporn) I came across a very, _very_ beatiful rice of arch linux. so I decided to get that kind of look and even though the github page had a warning that it will delete old configuration files and that it may break my system. I mindlessly installed the dotfiles and rebooted my system and it all looked very messed up. I, being a noob in the linux world didnt know how to fix the issue so I decided it was time to switch to something else, but instead of trying out something that is begginer friendly and has a nice GUI, I went straight into arch linux.

I found a [tutorial](https:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PBqpX0%5FUOc) on how to install arch linux by luke smith (great channel btw). I installed arch with a couple of failed attempts but ended up succeding. I then decided to install kde because I had been using gnome for a little bit on ubuntu and I got a bit bored of it.

a few weeks later I discovered brodie robertson, a linux youtuber who, at the time was using bspwm, around that time luke smith also made a video talking about bspwm and how good it is and I thought that was enough for me to make the switch. I have had a very small experience with Window managers before as I have once tried installing i3 but that failed miserably and I never came back to i3 again. anyways going back to bspwm, since I had the whole summer to play with it I decided to try and rice it on my own instead of using someone else's rice, I went with the gruvbox colorscheme

And a few months later, I discovered [larbs](https:larbs.xyz), a bootstrapping script created to make it easier to install luke smith's arch linux configuration, which came with dwm and st and dmenu (basically the whole suckless collection) and I got hooked to the suckless philosophy.

and here I am now, currently using my own build of xmonad after leaving larbs to create something on my own, the dotfiles are not completly ready yet but I hope that I will be able to make my own bootstrapping script sometime this year.

and that's about it!
