<span class="leadin">Today, I wanted to make a module </span>for my AwesomeWM status bar that shows the currently playing Spotify song, it'd be nice if it could show something human-readable like this: _Wild World by Yusuf/Cat Stevens_.

Through a quick search, I found a tiny bash script, [sp](https://gist.github.com/streetturtle/fa6258f3ff7b17747ee3), that does what I need. except the output must be cleaned up.

```fish title="sp current's output"
joe@popos> sp current
Album        Tea For The Tillerman (Remastered 2020)
AlbumArtist  Yusuf / Cat Stevens
Artist       Yusuf / Cat Stevens
Title        Wild World
```

I could ask chatgpt to format this or write a Lua script, but that wouldn't be much fun, _would it?_ in this article, we'll learn how to use <Code code="awk" />, <Code code="sed" /> and other commands to get the desired output.
<Callout title="Intended Audience"> this is intended for people who have used Linux but are otherwise new to the terminal, if you've at least created a file from the command line, you're good to go, I'll cover everything else throughout the article</Callout>

If you want to follow along, download the bash script, and experiment with the commands we'll learn, but that's not required per se.

### Mini Problem #1

To get started <Code code="sp current" lang="bash" /> returns the album name, album artist, song artist, and song title, whereas we only need the artist and title. we can use <Code code="sed" /> to pick the specific lines we need.

sed works by looping through lines of the input and doing a given action, by default it prints the resulting lines to <abbr title="standard output">stdout</abbr>. we can give sed a file to work with but more commonly you'll pipe a command into sed, as we'll do later on.

> <details><summary>What do you mean by **_pipe_**? </summary>Generally, in Linux, a command's input is read from the keyboard and its output (along with any errors) is printed on your screen. we can, however, change this behavior. <br /> <br/> 
> piping essentially lets you pass a command's output onto another command's input. programs can choose whether or not to support piping, but most basic Linux programs (and all the ones we'll discuss today) support it. </details>

let's look into sed in more detail
```bash
sp current | sed '' # no action given, sed will print the lines as is
sp current | sed 's/Cat/Dog/g' # replace Cat with Dog and print every line
```

```bash /-n/
# the n flag suppresses the automatic printing
# this will replace Cat with Dog but print nothing!
sp current | sed -n 's/Cat/Dog/g' 
```

```bash /'p'/
# p prints a line
# so this will print each line twice (default + p action)
sp current | sed 'p'
  
# if we combine -n with the p action we can do this
# this is equivalent to plain sed ''
sp current | sed -n 'p'
  
# we can print a specific line too (we'll need this later!)
# this will print every line AND print the second line an extra time
sp current | sed '2p'
```

```bash
# finally, we can chain actions.
# this substitutes Cat with Dog and prints ONLY the 2nd line, because of the n flag.
sp current | sed -n 's/Cat/Dog/g;2p'
```

and now—as you may have already figured out—we can print the artist and song name only like so:

```bash
sp current | sed -n '3p;4p'
```
and we end up with
```plaintext 
Artist       Yusuf/Cat Stevens
Title        Wild World
```

### Mini Problem #2

Next, we need to get rid of the column labels, we can use <Code code="cut" /> for this. As with <Code code="sed" />, <Code code="cut" /> accepts a file as its input, if no file is given it'll read from <abbr title="standard input">stdin</abbr>.

Here is how we usually work with <Code code="cut" />, you give it a delimiter and a set of columns to print, and it will split each line by that delimiter and return the selected columns.

in our case, columns are separated with a space, so we can do the following

```bash /-d ' '/ /-f2/
# we're splitting the input by spaces and picking the 2nd column
sp current | cut -d ' ' -f2
```

our columns are seperated by multiple spaces though, so cut will treat the empty-ness between each space as its own column, to avoid this we can inject the command <Code code="tr" /> to trim the extra spaces:

```bash /tr -s ' '/
# the s flag specifies what to trim
sp current | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f2
```


But this is still not totally right. if a song's title contains more than one word we'll get this
```plaintext
Artist       Yusuf/Cat Stevens // [!code --]
Title        Wild World // [!code --]
 
Yusuf/Cat  // [!code ++] 
Wild // [!code ++]
```

you can pass <Code code="cut" /> a column range to print, as in <Code code="cut -d ' ' -f2-4" lang="bash" /> to select the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th columns, **if the range is open-ended**, <Code code="cut" /> **will print every column until the end of the line**, so let's incorporate that into our script.

```bash /-f2-/
sp current | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f2- | sed -n '3p;4p'
```
output:

```plaintext
Yusuf/Cat Stevens
Wild World
```

**note**: as I've shown you <Code code="tr" /> needs to be applied before <Code code="cut" /> on the contrary, <Code code="cut" /> and <Code code="sed" /> can be swapped because they serve entirely different purposes.


### Mini Problem #3

Now, what's left is to simply join the lines and format them nicely. we can use <Code code="awk" /> to do this.

<Code code="awk" /> is based on a condition-script model, It's similar to <Code code="sed" /> it checks if the current line matches the condition and executes the appropriate script, although I find <Code code="awk" /> to have a more expressive syntax.

awk scripts are written in quotes like this:

```bash
sp current | awk '{print $1}'
```
let's look at a few examples. any of these can be passed to awk in quotes.

```awk
{print} # no condition given, prints every line.
  
# NR==1 matches the 1st line only
# thus, this will print the 1st line
NR==1{print} 
  
# any subsequent script isn't part of the condition. 
# despite them being on the same line.
# this will print the print every line + the first line again
NR==1{print}{print}
```

```awk
# awk has pre-defined globals corresponding to columns in your input
# this behaves like sed and will print the first column.
{print $1}
 
# $0 matches the entire line
# this is equivalent to {print}
{print $0}
```
Lastly, you can assign globals to variables, 

this assigns a to the 1st column of the 1st line and then prints <Code code="x" /> for every line in the input. 
 note that the first script only runs once, thus a will stay the same for every line
```awk
NR==1{x=$1}{print x}
```
now we can combine everything we know to get this script:

```bash
sp current | ... | awk 'NR==1{a=$0; next}{print $0 " by " a}'
```

this does the following:
1. we assign <Code code="a" /> to the artist name (entire first line)
2. <Code code="skip" lang="awk" /> tells <Code code="awk" /> to _skip_ the execution of the second script and to move to the next line
3. we're on the second line now so <Code code="NR==1" lang="awk" /> isn't matched and the first script is skipped.
4. print the song name (<Code code="$0" lang="awk" />) then the string literal <Code code="by" /> then the artist name (content of variable <Code code="a" />)

```
Yusuf/Cat Stevens // [!code --]
Wild World // [!code --]
 
Wild World by Yusuf/Cat Stevens // [!code ++]
```

## Final Thoughts
That concludes our script, here is what we ended up with:
```bash 
sp current | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f2- | sed -n '3p;4p' | awk 'NR==1{a=$0; next}{print $0 " by " a}'
```

Now this script could be optimized in different ways, but instead of showing you how to do it here, I leave that as _an exercise to the reader_. here are a couple of things you can do, ranging from easiest to hardest:
- replace the <Code code="cut" /> command with an additional <Code code="sed" /> action
- re-write the entire thing from memory
- make the script as short as possible
- write the entire script in <Code code="awk" />

Finally, I hope you learned something new today and if you attempt any of these, please share what you did either in the mastodon replies or through an article on your blog. I promise to take a look and I'll probably learn something myself!
