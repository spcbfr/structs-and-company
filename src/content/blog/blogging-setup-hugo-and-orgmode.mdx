Yesterday, I've rewritten my blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) , but with a spin; instead of using the usual <Code code="markdown -> hugo -> html" />, I've went with ox-hugo which adds another layer to this process so it becomes <Code code="org -> markdow -> hugo -> html"/> and I've done this for a few reasons

-   I am already using org-mode for my private notes, if I ever decide to make a note public that would be very easy with both my private and public notes using the same syntax
-   ox-hugo is really easy to use, especially since I am using [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) and it can be enabled as an org-mode flag using <Code code="(org +hugo)"/>

so, with that said, let's get into the fun stuff !


## Starting a new hugo blog

go ahead and install hugo, either from your distro's package manager or using npm (<Code code="npm -g hugo-cli"/>). for me, I'll be using pacman

```bash
sudo pacman -S hugo
```

next, initialize your hugo project, using their cli

```bash
hugo new site project-name
```

this will create a directory called <Code code="project-name"/> that contains the project starter
next, you need to pick a theme for your blog, you can find some community-made themes in [Hugo's Website](https://themes.gohugo.io/)

<Img src="/hugo-themes.png" alt="A group of hugo themes" />

once you've picked a theme that you like, just clone the github repo into your Hugo's theme directory (<Code code="project-name/themes" />)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git themes/hello-friend-ng
```

finally update your <Code code="config.toml" /> to apply the theme that you've just downloaded, and while you're at it, you might as well update the blog's metadata (title, description, language, etc..)

```toml
baseurl      = "/"
title        = "My Blog"
languageCode = "en-us"
theme        = "theme-name"
...
```

you can now visit your site by running this command and opening localhost on port 1313

```ansi
[youssef@tux ~/repos/hugo-blog]$ hugo server -D
Start building sites â€¦
hugo v0.88.1+extended linux/amd64 BuildDate=unknown

## Installing and configuring ox-hugo

ox-hugo is the package we are going to use to transform our org file(s) to markdown which then will be parsed by hugo


### Installing ox-hugo


**Vanilla emacs**

you can install ox-hugo using <Code code="use-package"/>

```lisp
(use-package ox-hugo
  :ensure t            ;Auto-install the package from Melpa (optional)
  :after ox)
```


**Doom emacs**

You can enable hugo by just adding the hugo flag to the org module in your <Code code="init.el" /> so it looks something like this <Code code="(org +hugo)" />


### Integrating ox-hugo into our hugo blog

there are two ways to use ox-hugo:

1.  all the posts in one org file, one post per-subtree (**Recommended**)
2.  one post per org file

you may be more familiar with the second option but having all of the posts in one file has its benefits too

-   makes the meta-data management for Hugo front-matter pretty effortless.
-   you can use org mode's [Tag Inheritance](https://orgmode.org/manual/Tag-Inheritance.html) feature

so now that is out of the way, start by creating an org-file in your project's root, you can call it whatever you want. next, add a local variable at the top of the page and call it <Code code="HUGO_BASE_DIR" /> and set this to the absolute path to your hugo project, for me that looks something like this

```plaintext
#+HUGO_BASE_DIR: ~/repos/hugo-blog
```


### Write your first post!

to make a new post you just need to add a new top-level heading to the org-file that we created, but you also need a bit of metadata. here is an example post:

```plaintext
* Blog Post name
:properties:
:export_file_name: blog-post-name-in-url
:export_description: my cool post
:export_date: 2021-10-18
:export_author: your name
:end:

post's content !
```

finally to export the file to markdown you can run the <Code code="org-hugo-export-wim-to-md" /> function to export the blogpost to markdown and place it in the content folder in your hugo project
on doom emacs, you can also use the keybinding <kbd>SPC</kbd> <kbd>m</kbd> <kbd>e</kbd> <kbd>H</kbd> <kbd>H</kbd> to do the same thing
now if you open localhost:1313 (make sure the hugo server is still running) you will see your newly created blog post show up !

And that's about it, I hope you've found this helpful, reply below and I'll make sure to check it out.
