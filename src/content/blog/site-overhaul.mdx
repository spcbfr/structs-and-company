After a nearly 7 month long hiatus from working on this site, I am back to blogging once again. This time with a major blog overhaul. One of the reasons I stopped writing is the amount of work required to push new articles. The new system is much easier and will hopefully allow me to stay consistent.

With that out of the way, here's everything about the new site.

# The Design
<div class="grid place-content-center place-items-center sm:scale-100 scale-75">
  <Img 
    src="/og-image.png"
    alt=""
    class="sm:w-[36rem] w-[30rem] -rotate-12 [grid-row:1] [grid-column:1]"
  />
  <Img 
    src={homepage}
    alt=""
    class="sm:w-[30rem] w-[24rem] -rotate-6 [grid-row:1] [grid-column:1]"
  />
  <Img 
    src={about}
    alt="Screenshot of about page" 
    class="sm:w-[30rem] w-[24rem] rotate-12 [grid-row:1] [grid-column:1]"
  />
</div>
<p class="!text-sm !text-stone-600/90 italic text-center">A snapshot of the current design</p>

<Aside>Oh, You've redecorated! I don't like it — The `10`th Doctor </Aside>

For this iteration, I wanted to try something completely new for me. Initially I had a very old-school, 1930s magazine-esque style in mind. The final design didn't turn out as _“out there”_ as I had imagined, but I am nonetheless very happy with what I turned out with.

I chose to go with a serif only collection of fonts, to suit the old-school aesthetic. It looks very elegant and pairs surprisingly well with monospace code blocks.

One UX decision I spent a long time thinking about is whether to list all the articles on the homepage — which is what I had been doing before — or in a separate /posts page, eventually I settled on the second option, because the number of posts is only going to grow and the homepage won't handle that well. I still list my favorite articles on the homepage for better discoverability.

# Framework change

I've switched from NextJS + Contentlayer to Astro. contentlayer had very good premise but it's sadly no longer maintained (well, [_barely_ maintained](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/429)) and NextJS seemed like an overkill for my needs. On the other hand, Astro implements syntax highlighting out of the box and it's syntax is closer to vanilla JS. I am sure problems with astro will eventually crop up but so far it's been very stable.

I was very tempted to switch to [`11`ty](https://11ty.dev) instead but a fully static site can't handle the experiments I run every now and then. 11ty remains a very good choice for most people, check it out if you haven't already.

One more thing: I am dropping the [webmentions support](/https://yusuf.fyi/posts/receiving-blog-replies-from-anywhere) and spotify widget for the time being, I can't delay this overhaul any further. They'll back soon though.

**Update**: webmentions are now back and improved!

# There's more

and now for a couple of small _Quality of Life_ improvements:

- Cleaner layout when printing an article. I basically hide everything that's not content (headers, navigation, etc..) and display the full URL after links. Thanks to [Juhis](https://hamatti.org/posts/recent-evolution-of-my-note-taking-systems) for the idea
- my [RSS feed](/rss.xml) is now styled when opened in a browser. Yes, you can style an RSS feed, and it's cool as heck. Oh and don't worry, the feed is still parse-able by your reader
- made a [now/](/now), can I be one of the cool kids now?

That's all folks, i will see you ~in the next yearly blog redesign~ next week.
