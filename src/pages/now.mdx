This is my now page, written from my computer on neovim. the date shown above is when this was last updated. if you have your own site, you should make one, too.

## What's going?
- Finished redesigning the site, I think it looks really nice. if you see this page, you're looking at the new design.
- We're about Â¾ of the way through the month of Ramadan. not sleeping as much as I'd like but I am powering through.
- [my latest article](/linux-text-manipulation) went semi-viral on hackernews, I am glad I made the site look good on mobile half an hour before it being shared on HN, since most of my visitors were on IOS and Android.

## Favorite Songs
These are songs I am "Obssesed with" at the moment, not my general favorite songs
- **Creep** by Radiohead
- **Wonderful Life** by Black
- **Chasing Pavements** by Adele

## Things I am into
