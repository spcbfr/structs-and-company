Heya, my name is yusuf, a software engineer and writer on my own small "patch of land" on the internet. I created this site because I am a believer in the indie web and want to free myself from the control of the corporate overlords

I have a crappy bike but I enjoy cycling nonetheless, I plan to go on a big country tour on bike in summer 2025.

I like talking with people and I am generally very extroverted

Although I seem passionate about software development, my end goal in life is ~World Dominaâ€“~ to own a farm somewhere in Ireland. Hopefully that happens some time in the next decade.

I like to watch, read and listen to a lot of stuff, my favorite podcast is _[darknet dairies](https://darknetdiaries.com/)_ and my favorite movie is _[12 Angry Men](https://letterboxd.com/film/12-angry-men/)_, I've been watching _Doctor Who_ since I was 5, currently watching classic who for the first time. I've yet to find a book I'd consider my favorite.
